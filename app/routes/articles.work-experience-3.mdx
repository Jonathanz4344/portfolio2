title: Full Stack Engineer Intern @ Citywide Eye Care
abstract: During my Full Stack Engineer Internship at Citywide Eye Care, I designed and deployed a scalable full-stack solution to modernize clinic operations. I developed an interactive, user-friendly interface using React.js and Material-UI, increasing patient engagement by 87% based on user feedback. I implemented an efficient inventory management system with Python and PostgreSQL, reducing stock discrepancies by 30%. Additionally, I optimized AWS cloud services (EC2, S3, RDS) to achieve 99.9% uptime while enhancing data security by integrating AWS Secrets Manager. I also automated online form processing workflows, improving data handling speed by 35% and reducing staff response time by 30%.
